                Springfield. The main characters include <b>Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie,</b> each with their

                ensemble of recurring and one-off characters, making Springfield a rich and vibrant universe. Fans often
                appreciate the subtle references, clever wordplay, and layered jokes that appeal to both children and
